# Module 1 Challenge!

## Description

My motivation for this project was to to refactor the index.html and style.css for the Horeiseon website and implement semantic elements to raise the SEO(Search Engine Optimization). I also added alt text to images as well to increase readability for those on screen readers and other assistive technology, this solves some of its accessibility issues and leads to a higher SEO among the other changes I made. During this project I learned how to refactor html and css code into a more organized viewing for both me and the browser and how to replace dated code with more semantic elements.

## Usage

While this website is mostly static, the ways you can interact with it are in the header bar listing "Search Engine Optimization", "Online Reputation Management",and "Social Media Marketing". Each of these will bring you directly to the specified part of the website in a quick and time efficient manner.
